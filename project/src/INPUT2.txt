I'm lost in your world. 
Looking for a purpose
That belongs to me only
May the lilies bloom for me
Do you hear the lilies speak?
The leaves kissing the bees
The soil covering up all
The sorrow
All the seeds I sowed
In a garden can't be
Claimed by me
Do you hear the lilies speak?
I gave it my all
Isn't it supposed
To be sunny now?
But my rain won't stop
My rain won't stop
The hell I saw, voices I heard
The dreams that I lost changed
Nothing at all
I'm still my insufferable self
Setting my hair on fire
Giving you warmth
Hoping you'd realize
I want you by my side
May the lilies bloom for me
Thought I would be satisfied
Seeing you content
At the other side
But somehow I thought
These crazy thoughts
That I deserve to be loved
I deserve to know love
We deserve to live in love
I wish there's no end
I wish there's no end
To our time together
The lilies wilted
Waving down into my coffin
Goodbye, my youth expensed
Goodbye, my innocence
Should I be mad?
Should I be glad?
Am I enough?
How can I be enough?
So I'm proud of myself
Reaching my goals
Distracting my feelings changed
Nothing at all
I'm still my insatiable self
Isn't it better to be dumb?
To be ignorant?
Not knowing there is liberty in
This world not meant for me
May the lilies bloom for me
